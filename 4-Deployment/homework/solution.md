## Homework

In this homework, we'll deploy the ride duration model in batch mode. Like in homework 1, we'll use the Yellow Taxi Trip Records dataset. 

You'll find the starter code in the [homework](homework) directory.

Solution: [homework_solution/](homework_solution/)

```bash
pipenv install scikit-learn==1.5.0
```


## Q1. Notebook

We'll start with the same notebook we ended up with in homework 1.
We cleaned it a little bit and kept only the scoring part. You can find the initial notebook [here](starter.ipynb).

Run this notebook for the March 2023 data.

What's the standard deviation of the predicted duration for this dataset?

* 1.24
* 6.24
* 12.28
* 18.28

### Answer Q1

`6.24`


## Q2. Preparing the output

Like in the course videos, we want to prepare the dataframe with the output. 

First, let's create an artificial `ride_id` column:

```python
df['ride_id'] = f'{year:04d}/{month:02d}_' + df.index.astype('str')
```

Next, write the ride id and the predictions to a dataframe with results. 

Save it as parquet:

```python
df_result.to_parquet(
    output_file,
    engine='pyarrow',
    compression=None,
    index=False
)
```

What's the size of the output file?

* 36M
* 46M
* 56M
* 66M

### Answer Q2

```bash
du -sh output/yellow/yellow_scores_2023-03.parquet 
# 65M     output/yellow/yellow_scores_2023-03.parquet
```

`66M`


## Q3. Creating the scoring script

Now let's turn the notebook into a script. 

Which command you need to execute for that?

### Answer Q3

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script homework.ipynb
```

Then the exported script is renamed with this:
```bash
mv homework.py score.py
```

## Q4. Virtual environment

Now let's put everything into a virtual environment. We'll use pipenv for that.

Install all the required libraries. Pay attention to the Scikit-Learn version: it should be the same as in the starter
notebook.

After installing the libraries, pipenv creates two files: `Pipfile`
and `Pipfile.lock`. The `Pipfile.lock` file keeps the hashes of the
dependencies we use for the virtual env.

What's the first hash for the Scikit-Learn dependency?

### Answer Q4

`057b991ac64b3e75c9c04b5f9395eaf19a6179244c089afdebaad98264bff37c`


## Q5. Parametrize the script

Let's now make the script configurable via CLI. We'll create two 
parameters: year and month.

Run the script for April 2023. 

What's the mean predicted duration? 

* 7.29
* 14.29
* 21.29
* 28.29

*Hint*: just add a print statement to your script.

### Answer Q5

Run the scoring script with this command:
```bash
python3 score.py --year 2023 --month 4 --model model.bin --taxi_type yellow
```

You will get the following result for the mean predicted duration:

`14.29`


## Q6. Docker container 

Finally, we'll package the script in the docker container. 
For that, you'll need to use a base image that we prepared. 

This is what the content of this image is:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10.13-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY [ "model2.bin", "model.bin" ]
```

Note: you don't need to run it. We have already done it.

It is pushed to [`agrigorev/zoomcamp-model:mlops-2024-3.10.13-slim`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/agrigorev/zoomcamp-model/mlops-2024-3.10.13-slim/images/sha256-f54535b73a8c3ef91967d5588de57d4e251b22addcbbfb6e71304a91c1c7027f?context=repo),
which you need to use as your base image.

That is, your Dockerfile should start with:

```dockerfile
FROM agrigorev/zoomcamp-model:mlops-2024-3.10.13-slim

# do stuff here
```

This image already has a pickle file with a dictionary vectorizer
and a model. You will need to use them.

Important: don't copy the model to the docker image. You will need
to use the pickle file already in the image. 

Now run the script with docker. What's the mean predicted duration
for May 2023? 

* 0.19
* 7.24
* 14.24
* 21.19

### Answer Q6

<details>
<summary><b>Dockerfile</b></summary>

```dockerfile
FROM agrigorev/zoomcamp-model:mlops-2024-3.10.13-slim

WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install -U pip
RUN pip install pipenv

COPY ["Pipfile", "Pipfile.lock", "./"]
RUN pipenv install --system --deploy

COPY ["score.py", "./"]

ENTRYPOINT [ "python3", "score.py" ]
```

</details>

The scoring script is executed with:
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
    -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
    mlops-hw4 \
    --year 2023 \
    --month 5 \
    --local
```
